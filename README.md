## Heritage
This addon started out as a fork of Shagu's pfUI. The general idea at first was just to tweak some things to have it look exactly as I wanted, and as time moved on I started to add other features with the purpose of having the most crucial features under the same "roof" and as light-weight as possible. I've always wanted to preserve the blizzard UI in some ways and I really liked the look of Modernist's modUI which is the foundation of the art decisions made here. So these guys deserve a big thank you becuase they are the reason this addon exist! Please check out their work and leave a star www.gitlab.com/Shagu , www.github.com/obble
